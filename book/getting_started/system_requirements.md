# System Requirements

**Disclaimer**: The information provided is only a rough estimate based on current node implementations, and may not be representative of all node implementations. We plan to conduct benchmarking and optimization tests to ensure the best performance for each specific audience.

## Hardware
- 64-bit architecture.
- We recommend a minimum of 8GB RAM 
- We recommend using an SSD or NVMe, as an HDD may cause the node to fall behind the chain tip. Note that SSD performance can deteriorate when close to capacity.


### Archive node
- TODO: We will update the disk usage estimate once it is ready.

### Full node
- TODO: We will update the disk usage estimate once it is ready.



## Software
- rustc 1.66.0 (69f9c33d7 2022-12-12)
- libclang-dev
- pkg-config
