# Node

Reth is a new Ethereum full node that allows users to sync and interact with the entire blockchain, including its historical state if in archive mode. 

- Full node: It can be used as a full node, which stores and processes the entire blockchain, validates blocks and transactions, and participates in the consensus process. 

- Archive node: It can also be used as an archive node, which stores the entire history of the blockchain and is useful for applications that need access to historical data.
